# WaddleBot Listener

This listener is responsible for the handling commands that are read through the Matterbridge component of the core system. Its also responsible for the connection to the Redis Cache for command retrieval. (WIP: Main redis cache still needs to be implemented. Currently uses a local Redis cache)

# Basic Setup

## 1. Python local testing

To test the API without it being in a container, do the following:

1. Ensure that you have python installed on your local machine, preferably v3.12.

To check if its installed correctly, run the following command in the terminal:

`py --version`

If its installed correctly, you will see this output:

`Python 3.12.3`

2. Install the python virtual environment in the root folder of the project by typing:

`py -m venv ./venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment by running:

`venv\scripts\activate.bat`

4. Install the requirements of the script by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Ensure that the following environmental variables are available:

`
MATTERBRIDGE_URL
USER_MANGER_URL
MARKETPLACE_URL
COMMUNITY_MODULES_URL
CONTEXT_URL
REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PORT
`

6. Run the app by running the following command while having the virtual env active:

`py listener.py`
